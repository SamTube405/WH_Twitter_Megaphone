**[Twitter is the Megaphone of Cross-Platform Messaging on the White Helmets](https://www.cse.usf.edu/dsg/data/publications/papers/megaphone-sameera-brims20.pdf)**

## Coding
We classify the urls mentioned in Twitter messages around White Helmets discussions into eight classes by their domains, this approach followed an iterative and collaborative decision process to finalize the identification. The classification of alternative news media domains is considered pejorative to the classification of mainstream news media domains similar to Starbirds et al.[2]
> 1. YouTube
> 2. Social media platforms (SM) (excluding YouTube)
> 3. Mainstream media domains (MSM),
> 4. Alternative media domains (ALT),
> 5. Fact-checking (FACT CHECK), 
> 6. Government (GOV), 
> 7. WH official media outlets (WH) and, 
> 8. Other web domains (OTHER) that are not mapped to any other classes.
